# AirShare
AirShare is a wrapper around sftp with a simple ui meant to be a replacement for my use case of AirDrop.

### How to Use
 - Simply download the right apk for your android phone architecture and install it.
 - That's it! If you're not sure how to establish the connection to your pc just click on the '?' icon.
 - You can simply select any file and send it to your pc.

### Limitation
The project has no grand aspiration I just wanted to send in one click big files to my pc without bloating my cloud storage.
- Data cannot be sent from a computer to the phone.
- Data cannot be sent between users.
- The Devices need to share a network (limitation of ftp).
- *important* not a limitation but a product of my lazyness user info is stored in a plain .txt in the app's private storage. As far as I know other apps cannot access it, except if given permission. if you want to delete it simply head to your phone's setting go to the app and erase the app's storage(app may break).

### Future scope
If you use it and have problems or recommendations do not hesitate to email me @eikono@proton.me
